This is a custom built 2D clone of the original Super Mario Bros., written entirely in C++ using the Raylib graphics library. It features basic physics, collision detection, level loading from maps, and object-oriented design principles such as smart pointers, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The overall goal of this project is to display stronger C++ knowlege and programming skills.

How To Run The Program On Your Machine
To run this make sure you have C++, Cmake, and Raylib installed on your machine.
Once you clone the directory onto your machine run:

cd SuperMarioBros/ <br>
mkdir build <br>
cd build/ <br>
